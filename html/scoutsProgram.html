	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Mission</strong>
		<br />The mission of the Boy Scouts of America is to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law. 
		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Purpose</strong>
		<br />Since 1930, the Boy Scouts of America has helped younger boys through Cub Scouting. It is a year-round family program designed for boys who are in the first grade through fifth grade (or 7, 8, 9, and 10 years of age). Parents, leaders, and organizations work together to achieve the purposes of Cub Scouting. Currently, Cub Scouting is the largest of the BSA's three membership divisions with membership over 1 million. (The others are Boy Scouting and Venturing.)
		<br />
		<br />The ten purposes of Cub Scouting are:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Character Development</li>
		<li>Spiritual Growth</li>
		<li>Good Citizenship</li>
		<li>Sportsmanship and Fitness</li>
		<li>Family Understanding</li>
		<li>Respectful Relationships</li>
		<li>Personal Achievement</li>
		<li>Friendly Service</li>
		<li>Fun and Adventure</li>
		<li>Preparation for Boy Scouts</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<strong>Member Organization</strong>
		<br />Cub Scouting members join a Cub Scout pack and are assigned to a den, usually a neighborhood group of six to nine boys. Tiger Cubs (first-graders), Wolf Cub Scouts (second graders), Bear Cub Scouts (third graders), and Webelos Scouts (fourth and fifth graders) meet weekly. Once a month, all of the dens and family members gather for a pack meeting under the direction of a Cubmaster and pack committee. The committee includes parents of boys in the pack and members of the chartered organization.
